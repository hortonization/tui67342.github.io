<p><i>Why</i> did it have to be <sub><b>me</b></sub><b>ee</b><sup><b>ee</b></sup></p>
	
<p><i><b>Alone</b></i></p>
	
<p> <b>in the world.</b> as one should not be
  <b>My</b>  was <b>never</b> there
  father I don't even know if he <b>cared.</b> <del> did he?</del>
  <b>My <i>MoM</i></b> was in a relationship for years
  I <b><i>saw</i></b> her <i>through</i> all her fears
  I <i>saw</i> her cry at night
  I <i>saw</i> the day she had to fight
</p>
	
<p>
  I was there through it all a
  Back then she seemed so small
  Now she stands so tall
  It is like she can touch &rdquo;the sky&ldquo;
  To those <b>problems</b> she said <i>bye</i>
  While I laid in bed <b>and wondered <i>why</i></b>
  My <i>perfect</i> <b>life just</b> fell, just <strong>died.</strong>
  My father choose to do things
  wrong
  Now just thinking about it stings
</p>
	
<p> <b>Now I</b> have five more sisters
  They make me <b>smile,</b> like no other
  My dad is having a wedding
  Now I thought that was just c r a z y
  My heart is <b>bleeding,</b> like it was stabbed with a knife
  But it's just me <b>wondering.</b> what happened to my perfect life
  Seven years have passed yet I still haven’t seen past
  The fear and anxiety that holds me
  <b>I have</b> two new families to learn and to grow with
  But the <b>fears</b> and anxiety still hold me
</p>
	
<p> What if they like my sisters more than the only boy of 7
  That would truly be tragic <b>but so far</b> that’s not true
  <b>I have</b> more family than ever before
  Having a true family has opened the door
  To <b>a brighter life,</b>
  A brighter <b>future,</b>
  A brighter <b>me.</b>
  <b>I’m</b> finally <b>happy</b>. </p>
